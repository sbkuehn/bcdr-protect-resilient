<br><br>1) Open up the .ps1 file (if you're familiar with Key Vault, select the Key Vault .ps1 and adjust the parameters file to run the template - if you're not familiar with Key Vault, open up the other .ps1).
<br>2) Read through the text in the .ps1 file. The file will take you through multiple steps and outline the flow of what this
<br>lab is trying to demonstrate. Inside each step, run the line of code individually for each step (DO NOT run the .ps1 as a 
<br>full script).
<br>3) If using the Key Vault .ps1, you will create a Key Vault within the PowerShell file and input a VM secret. This will be used to populate your parameters file later in the lab.
<br>4) Before running the last command, open up the parameters json file. Adjust the following: Environment Prefix, if running the non-Key Vault .ps1, or Environment Prefix and Key Vault reference if you used the Key Vault .ps1 (make sure the Key Vault reference is pointed to your subscription).
